# Extensionpoints

In the past, extensions were added by adding a field to a spec, using "__" as prefix. 
This was no problem, as long the complete build chain was js based, everyone could add
his extension to the spec. Adding your custom extensions is still supported, 
but they have to go to the field extensions. Extensionpoints are available for types, 
fields in types, services and methods in services. The __proto and __ui extensions were so broadly used, that 
they become a fix part of the specs.

Extensions can have any structure and can be used in furoc generator plugins or a scripts that consumes `spectools exportAsYaml -f`, which 
is nearly the same structure a furoc generator would receive.


{{< hint warning >}}
Extension are only available in the standard spec notation. You can not use them in ÂµSpecs.
